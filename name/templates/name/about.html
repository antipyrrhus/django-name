    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    The UNT Name App is a tool for documenting names used by the UNT Libraries in its various digital library systems and collections.  The app provides a consistent way of communicating the authorized version of a name and information about the name that is useful for reuse.  The UNT Name App generates a unique URL for each name that can be used to unambiguously refer to a person, organization, event or piece of software.  In addition to an HTML page for each name there are a number of other formats available for each record including a MADS XML version and a simple JSON representation.  A key feature of the UNT Name App is the ability to link to other vocabularies such as the Virtual International Authority File (VIAF), the Library of Congress Name Authority File, or Wikipedia.  As time permits, the UNT Libraries will integrate links into name records where appropriate.   A set of APIs are provided for integration of this application into other systems, like The Portal to Texas History, and the UNT Digital Library.   If you have questions or comments about the UNT Name App, or if you would like a name added, please contact Laura Waugh at <a href="mailto:laura.waugh@unt.edu">laura.waugh@unt.edu</a>.


<h3>Two search modes are available.</h3>
    Notice there are two modes of searching methods. The first mode is a traditional search which takes a query and a type, filtering records containing your query in either the authorized name field or the variant field. The second search method is more of an existence lookup of the authorized name. The user should request "{% absolute_url "name_label" "(name_string_here)" %}". The API will then either return a 302 Found and redirect to the matching record, or a 404 Not Found.<br>
    This page will first address the 'traditional' search API, then the label API.

    <h3>Search API</h3>
    <p>Lets dive right in! The following are various search examples using <a href="http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/documentation/curl/index.html">curl</a>:</p>

    <!--BEGIN CODE MARKUP-->

    <h3>Search return codes</h3>
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#2xx_Success">200 OK</a> response:
        <ul><li>user gave a fully-formed search query which returns a list of results in JSON format</li></ul>
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#4xx_Client_Error">410 Gone</a> response:
        <ul><li>user gives a request for a record that had existed, but has since been deleted</li></ul>
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#4xx_Client_Error">404 Not Found</a> response:
        <ul><li>user gives a request for a record that does not exist</li></ul>
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#4xx_Client_Error">403 Forbidden</a> response:
        <ul><li>user gives a request for a record that exits, but is non-public</li></ul>
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#3xx_Redirection">302 Redirect</a> response:
        <ul><li>user requests a record which has been merged with another record</li></ul>

    <!--BEGIN PARAMETERS-->
    <h3>How can I narrow my search?</h3>
    Parameters hang off the end of a search request to narrow the results you get in your response and will get you closer to the name you are attempting to lookup.<br>
    <b>q</b>: <i>Optional</i> - the text respresentation of the record name you want to search. Here's the two optional parameters available to you in a traditional search.<br>
    <b>q_type</b>: <i>Optional</i> - the text represenation of the record type. 5 types are available to filter the search, "Personal", "Organization", "Event", "Building", "Software".<br>
    <b>callback</b>: <i>Optional</i> - the text represenation of the jsonp callback wrapper.<br>

    <!--  BEGIN LABEL API -->
    <h3>Label API</h3>
    The second method of searching is with the 'label' API. The label API is essentially a quick way to determine if an authorized name exists in the name app. The only two responses to this API are a 404 Not Found or a 302 Redirect.
    <pre>
    $ curl "{% absolute_url "name_label" "joey-not-here" %}"
    No matching term found - authoritative, or variant - for "joey-not-here"

    $ curl -I "{% absolute_url "name_label" "thisrecordisforsureinthedatabase" %}"
    HTTP/1.0 302 FOUND
    Date: Mon, 25 Feb 2013 22:33:19 GMT

    Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
    Location: {% absolute_url "name_entry_detail" "nm0000085" %}
    </pre>

    <h3>Label return codes</h3>
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#4xx_Client_Error">404 Not Found</a> response:
        <ul><li>user gives an authorized name that does not exist in the Names App database</li></ul>
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#3xx_Redirection">302 Redirect</a> response:
        <ul><li>user gives an authorized name that does exist in the Names App database. The system redirects to the corresponding record</li></ul>
