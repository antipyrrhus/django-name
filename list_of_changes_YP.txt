- Converted to Pipenv and upgraded to latest versions of EACH library
  in requirements.txt. Chief amongst the upgrades are new versions of
  python and django (respectively 3.7.4 and 2.2.6).

- Pipenv failed in installing mysql-python since it does not support python3
  as of 2019.10. See https://pypi.org/project/MySQL-python/
  ("Python-3.0 will be supported in a future release.")
  Hence, we'll see if we can survive with the built-in sqlite3 for
  initial testing purposes.

- Cleared the migration directory and re-ran makemigrations / migrate /
  superuser creation, as the old version ran on mysql-python which is
  incompatible with python3 as indicated above.

- As of 2019.10, pynaco does not officially support Python3. However,
  its github page has a branch 'py3' which contains the updated naco.py file.
  Grabbed the updated file from
  https://github.com/unt-libraries/pynaco/tree/py3/pynaco
  and copy-pasted into our copy of the same file in our
  Pipenv virtual environment.
- Various other changes were made to the code to account for the
  above-mentioned upgrades.
